# FAQ

## Why this project?

At the time of writing this:
- There are neither public API nor open data officially from both Prasarana and KTM Berhad.
- There is an immense lack of accessibility information and station maps online, to the point that you need to be in the station physically, and even that is not a guarantee. This also includes popular destinations near these stations.ations.

As such, this project is developed with the following intentions:
- It prioritizes any information that a commuter may need during their commute. While it's possible to add extra information such as a name sponsor of a station (e.g. KL Sentral-**redONE**), those will not be the focus.
- The license is picked with the intent to allow any interested developers, commercial or not, to use the data and content for as long as they properly credit the contributors of this project *and* contribute back to the project, either directly, or by releasing their own modified datasets with their contributions and a compatible license. By pure coincidence, Wikipedia has the exact same license, meaning certain unofficial data e.g. Chinese translations of station names and unofficial station codes are readily available to us.
- Thus, this project aims to eventually be *a* crowdsourced central open data hub specifically for public transport in Malaysia, starting with the Klang Valley rail services, as well as getting both Prasarana and KTM Berhad to open up their APIs and data for public use.
